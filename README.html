    <p>libnIDE is an IDE for DS programmers using libnds! It is in early development and it might be a while until it gets an update because I'm really busy with developing <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CqrXmqxAf8">DS Creator (Discord Server).</a>\nlibnIDE was made with the Electron framework. Here are all the planned features for libnIDE,\n\n- Line Numbers\n- Built-in Emulator\n- Projects\n\nI hope this is helpful or something...</p>
