    <h1>UPDATE:</h1>
    <h3>Since I haven't had a whole lot of time to spend on this and also some bugs I don't know how to fix, I am going to stop work on libnIDE. No, not permanently, but for a while. Just super busy with <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CqrXmqxAf8">DS Creator</a>.</h3>
    <h1>libnIDE</h1>  
    <p>libnIDE is an IDE for DS programmers using libnds! It is in early development and it might be a while until it gets an update because I'm really busy with developing <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CqrXmqxAf8">DS Creator (Discord Server).</a><br>libnIDE was made with the Electron framework. Here are all the planned features for libnIDE,<br><br>- Line Numbers<br>- Built-in Emulator<br>- Projects<br><br>I hope this is helpful or something...</p>
