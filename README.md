libnIDE
=======

libnIDE is an IDE for DS programmers using libnds! It is in early development and it might be a while until it gets an update because I'm really busy with developing [DS Creator (Discord Server).](https://discord.com/invite/CqrXmqxAf8)  
libnIDE was made with the Electron framework. Here are all the planned features for libnIDE,  
  
\- Line Numbers  
\- Built-in Emulator  
\- Projects  
  
I hope this is helpful or something...
